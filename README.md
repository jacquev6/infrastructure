This [infrastructure as code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) repository manages the infrastructure I use at various "cloud" providers and at home.

It uses [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to create the infrastructure itself ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/), [UptimeRobot](uptimerobot.com/)) and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) to install software and configure [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) environments.

# Usage

Use the scripts in the root directory.
